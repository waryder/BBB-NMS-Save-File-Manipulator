<h1>BBB NMS Save File Manipulator Overview and Purpose</h1>
<BR><BR>
<p>
DISCLAIMERS: I cannot be held liable for any damage this app causes. Period. I have been a software engineer for over 20 years and while I have a confidence in my work, I also
know end users will find every flaw in even the best engineered applications. I recommend that you save off back up copies of your save files before you use any editor at all, and be aware 
that BBB NMS Save File Manipulator must really be used by technical experts only. If you are not super comfortable with JSON files, file manipulation, and all aspects of what you see
in the app, just stop and do not use it!

This BBB NMS Save File Manipulator application is an attempt to plug some holes in fucntionality that I wanted to have related to NMS save file editing. First and foremost,  
the project started because I wanted to be able to sort bases by galaxy and system. It is primarily a JSON file editor and in fact, it will attempt to use and some features will work on...
any valid JSON data that is entered; it just may choke on any features that have been provided assuming the data will be as intended: NMS base data. 
<BR>

I found that while I was testing the app
there were numbers of things I just wanted to be able to do as related to the original purpose. I did not want to step on toes and so my intent was to duplicate as
little funtionality as possible available in the other major apps, those being goatfungus/NMSSaveEditor (https://github.com/goatfungus/NMSSaveEditor), 
zencq/NomNom (https://github.com/zencq/NomNom), and Dr Kaii's NMS Companion (https://www.nexusmods.com/nomanssky/mods/1879). In fact, the easiest
way to pull in the original base data into my app will be with NMS Save Editor (covered more later).
<BR><BR>
Current Features at a high level:
-Base Data pasted from another save editor, into the text window to the right, will load the tree view.
-Tree data nodes may be dragged and dropped to manuall reorder within the tree. Tree view changed are automatically synced to the text window. Child nodes will be 
prevented from moving unless they have the same data type in their parent nodes.
Dragging upward amoungst direct siblings will drop the dragged node above above the targetted drop target.  
Dragging downward amoungst direct siblings will drop the dragged node below the targetted drop target. If you drop to a target under a different parent, the draggd node will always
drop below the drop target.
-You can freely edit the save data in the text window at will, similar to using any other basic text editor.  
-The "Tree Synched" LED indcates if the tree view data is consistent with the text view. This is green when they are in sync. If text data has been manually modified, The "Sync from Text Window" button will
need to be pressed before the tree data will represent the latest data in the text window.
-The Background Processing LED indicates if there is background processing happening. This app is intended to be able to work with very large files, but certain operations will cause lag and slowness
in the app until they complete. If this LED turns yellow you can still attempt further app use, but if you find you are not getting an immediate response to new inputs you may need to wait until
the LED turns green again. When the LED is green the app is in an idle state with little processing happening.
-Further features will be dicussed as driven by description of the various menu items. Go back to the main help index to step through that material.
