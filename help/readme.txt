Just some comments on current features:

The first thing is, this IS NOT meant to be a competitor to the existing editors. In fact I am in contact with NomNom's author and may use his code as a library later on, and have my contributions to his code awaiting his review. He is an amazing person as are all the devs that do these editors and modding! 

But basically my app is meant to capture things I want to be able to do, but the other well known editors don't currently allow. (Some versions of similar functions may be in lessor known tools, or I added anyhow because it was something too convenient to have it right at hand while using mine). But one objective is to try and not duplicate unique fucntionality that is already coded in others.

It started life essentially as a Json file editor as a basis, so when you boot it up that's what it will look like. A tree and a text edit windows.

The big features in mine at the current release are:
1) One click sort of bases by Galaxy, System, and then Name.
2) Drag and drop reordering of Bases.
3) One click upgrade of all Starships to Max stats and tech installed.
4) Drag and drop reordering of Starships
5) Inventory sort (really moving items). This is the least "finished/polished". I will be adding more categories to the possible sorting criteria. Also I do no checking to save users from moving items to the wrong inventories. For example right now it's on you to make sure you don't put non fish bait in the fish bait inventory. But basically you have a dialog box where you click a bunch of checkboxes to setup your sort...and then click a button to get your inventory items moved around as you want.
6) Saving off an inventory and restore it to any other inventory. The way this works is you save an inventory. On reimport, the items in that save overwrite the the target inventories items. This allows you to save off desired inventory items to refresh any inventory later with a known loadout.
7) relocate your player to locations stored in the save file "Teleport Endpoints" list. This is a list kept by the game of the last (potentially hundreds) of locations where you teleported to. You can use this to get back to places you visited in the past but never threw a base down.
8) Aside from those, you can pretty much modify any data in the save file at all, and general features provided as in any text editor and Json editor (with a tree view) that you may find out there.
