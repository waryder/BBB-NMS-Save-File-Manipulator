			<h1>BBB NMS Save File Manipulator Typical Usage Flow</h1>

			DISCLAIMERS: I cannot be held liable for any damage this app causes. Period. I have been a software engineer for over 20 years and while I have a confidence in my work, I also
			know end users will find every flaw in even the best engineered applications, whereas I am a one man show over here. :) I recommend that you save off back up copies of your save files before you use any editor at all, and be 
			aware 
			that BBB NMS Save File Manipulator must really be used by technical experts only. If you are not super comfortable with JSON files, file manipulation, and all aspects of what you see
			in the app, just stop and do not use it! If you do find any errors I need to know about, I am BigBuffaloBill over on Discord. But please DO NOT write and tell me I wrecked your game! My answer will be "no problem; 
			just use the backup file I told you to make and go restore yourself." :) I do use this application regularly myself at this point, but I make backups just in case!!
			</p>
			<p>
			Additionally, be advised that I will gloss over processes for getting the data out of another save file editor for use in this editor. This is by design as I really do not want anyone using this tool at its current
			level of development, who does not have enough of a skill set yet to know what I mean when I say "go get the base or starship data out of the other save editor." That said...
			</p>
			<p>
				The general intended flow is as follows, although in use I have added features that allow much convenience in varied uses and processes. But generally:
				<ul>
					<li>Similar to what is described for a tool like the Blender NMS Base Building Plugin, you would need to go to the right spot in something like the Goatfungus Save Editor and grab either all base data,
					or all starship date depending on which tab you are working in within the BBB NMS SFM, and then "Select All" text in the tab's text box and do a Paste to replace it. In other words you want the latest
					Goatfungus data to be the only data in the text box.<BR><BR>
					(Be advised that when you fire up this application for the first time, dummy example data is hardcoded so that the text windows are populated with something to look at. This data is for show 
					and for evaluation of the tool but not intended to be used for anything.) 
					</li>
					<li>Then you will do whatever work needed in BBB NMS SFM.
					</li>		
					<li>Then you will reverse the process, copy the data back out of the BBB NMS SFM and back into the Goatfungus or other save file editor to be saved in a live game context.
					</li>
				</ul>
