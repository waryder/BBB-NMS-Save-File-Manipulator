			<h1>BBB NMS Save File Manipulator - Help</h1>
			DISCLAIMERS: I cannot be held liable for any damage this app causes. Period. I have been a software engineer for over 20 years and while I have a confidence in my work, 
			I also know end users will find every flaw in even the best engineered applications, whereas I am a one man show over here. :) I recommend that you save off back up copies 
			of your save files before you use any editor at all, and be aware that BBB NMS Save File Manipulator must really be used by technical experts only. If you are not super 
			comfortable with JSON files, file manipulation, and all aspects of what you see in the app, just stop and do not use it! If you do find any errors I need to know about, 
			I am BigBuffaloBill over on Discord. But please DO NOT write and tell me I wrecked your game! My answer will be "no problem; just use the backup file I told you to make
			and go restore yourself." :) I do use this application regularly myself at this point, but I make backups just in case!!

				<li>
					<a href="#">Base Processing Tab</a>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<a href="#">File Menu</a><BR>
							Open, Save, Save As - Typical file operations, in this case specific to saving off the complete base data represented in the tab. For example, I might name one of these files
			"Save Slot 1 Bases".							<BR>
							<BR>
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#">Help Menu</a><BR>
							You are looking at it!<BR>
							<BR>
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<a href="#">Import 'BaseContext' Json from Clipboard button</a><BR>
								This button can be used at any time to load new data from your clipboard. <span style="color: red;">The ONLY allowed data is a copy of the entire BaseContext Json, sourced from
								another save editor such as GoatFungus.	</span>	Details of an example of grabbing this data are <a HREF="grabbing_basecontext_from_goatfungus.html">HERE</a>.<BR>
							<BR>
						</li>
						
						<li>
							<a href="#">Export 'BaseContext' Json to Clipboard button</a><BR>
								This Button copies the entire BaseContext Json to your system clipboard so you can paste and save it back into your live game via another save editor like GoatFungus.
							<BR>
						</li>						
						
						<li>
							<a href="#">Tree Window Functionality</a>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<a href="#">"Sync from Text Window" Button</a><BR>
							Syncs over data from the Text Edit box on the right. For performance reasons it is not prudent to update the tree on each key stroke in the text edit box. So instead we mark a status Led
					telling you a sync is needed, and then you can decide when you want do a sync.											<BR>
												<BR>
								</li>
								<li>
									<a href="#">"Tree Synced" LED</a><BR>
												
						Indicates if the tree needs to be synched from the Text Edit box on the right. If Green, they are synced. If Red they are not synced.												<BR>
													<BR>
								</li>		
								<li>
												<a href="#">"Sort By Gal, Sys, Name" Button</a><BR>
											
						Sorts all top level Base Nodes by Galaxy, then by System within Galaxy,and then alphbetically by Name within the System. 
						This function is really what motivated the entire application. In one click you have your bases organized in some way that makes sense.														<BR>
															<BR>
								</li>											
								<li>
												<a href="#">"Background Processing" LED</a><BR>
											
							Indicates if there is background processing happening. This app is intended to be able to work with very large files, but certain operations can cause lag
							and slowness
							in the app until they complete. (This was true especially early in development; at this point I have revised most operations observed to cause lag, however...) 
							If this LED turns yellow YOU MAY STILL attempt further app use, but if you find you are not getting an immediate response to new inputs you may need to wait until
							the LED turns green again. When the LED is green the app is in an idle state with little processing happening. (For techies: it's counting the number of child threads for the app
							and thresholds determined via observation)																<BR>
																	<BR/>
								</li>
								
								<li>
								<a href="#">Move Freight to Top on Sort checkbox</a><BR>
								When check, your freighter base will be sorted to the top of the list regardless of any other sort criteria.<BR><BR>
								</li>
								
								<li>
							<a href="#">Tree Drag and Drop Functionality</a><BR>
On the Base and Starship Processing Tabs, Tree data nodes may be dragged and dropped to manually reorder within the tree. Tree view changed are automatically synced to the text window. Child nodes will be 
prevented from moving unless they have the same data type in their parent nodes.
Dragging upward amoungst direct siblings will drop the dragged node above above the targetted drop target.  
Dragging downward amoungst direct siblings will drop the dragged node below the targetted drop target. If you drop to a target under a different parent, the draggd node will always
drop below the drop target. The primary tested purpose for this is to allow manual reordering of the highest level base tree nodes.																								<BR>
										<BR>

							</ul>	
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#">Text Area Window Functionality</a>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<a href="#">"Import from Clipboard" Button"</a><BR>
									This will REPLACE the full text in the text area window, with the text from your system clipboard as if you had done a select all, and paste. This is the easiest way
									to enter your current base data into this application. All views are updated with the new data.
									<BR>
									<BR>
								</li>
								<li>
									<a href="#">"Export to Clipboard" Button"</a><BR>
									This will COPY the full text from your text area window, into the system clipboard as if you had done a select all, and copy. This is the easiest way
									to grab all the data from this application, to be saved to the live game via Goatfungus or NomNom.
									<BR>
									<BR>
								</li>
								<li>
									<a href="#">"Pretty Print" Button"</a><BR>
									Reformats the bases Json in the text window in a more organized way.	
									<BR>
									<BR>
								</li>
								<li>
									<a href="#">Text Area Right Click Menu</a><BR>
									In this window the functionality will be pretty standard to any text editor. Of note, there is a search text feature.

							<ul>
								<li>
									<a href="#">Common Functionality</a><BR>
										As with most other detail in this "Starship Processing Tab" help section, much of the functionality is common to the information you may find up above,
										but in this case used in a context of Starship data instead of Base data. I will highlight the one major 
										difference next: the "Upgrade Starships" Button.<BR><BR>
								</li>
								<li>
									<a href="#">"Upgrade Starships" Button</a><BR>
									The functionality of this button will be to Upgrade all of your Starships as pasted into the text window, with one click. Read on to understand
									process and setup.<BR><BR>
									<ul>
										<li>
											<a href="#">General Functionality</a><BR>
												The way it works is, for each Starship, your Starship Name and Seed are saved off. The Starship Seed is a hex data value that is used by
												the game to specify all aesthetic aspects of your Starship. Build parts, color, physical configuration. We then replace each Starship's complete 
												data with upgraded reference Starship data for the same type (Fighter, Sentinel, Hauler, etc) of Starship as the original. We then overwrite
												the Name and Seed of the reference data with your orginal ship's data. In this way you end up with what is basically the same ship, but with all
												the upgrades applied to it. (Please read on...)<BR>
										<BR>
										</li>
										<li>
											<a href="#">Reference Ship Data</a><BR>
												For Each ship type of Explorer, Fighter, Hauler, Living, Royal, Sentinel, Shuttle, Solar (other ship types not yet tested, YMMV),
												there is a reference file that lives in the same
												directory as the program files, called respectfully: reference_explorer.json, reference_fighter.json, reference_hauler.json, reference_living.json,
												reference_royal.json,
												reference_sentinel.json, reference_shuttle.json, and reference_Solar.json. These come with the data I use to upgrade my own ships, but they each contain
												the Json for a standard starship as you can grab from the other save editors. If you want to apply your own upgrades you would just copy the Json data
												for a starship you want to use, and paste it into the appropriate reference file for the ship type. From that point on your data would be used for that
												Starship type. <BR>													
											<BR>
										</li>
										<li>
											<a href="#">Actual Button Usage</a><BR>
												When you hit the button you will be presented a dialog box allowing you to pick the starships you wish to upgrade. Only those startships indicated will
												be upgraded. Just check off those you want to upgrade and hit enter. The results will be propegated to the Tree and Text windows.<BR>
												<BR>
												<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">***IMPORTANT***: Do NOT attempt to upgrade custom built or expedition ships
												(Iron Vulture, Starborn Runner, etc)!!! I'll say it again: DO NOT ATTEMPT TO
												UPGRADE CUSTOM BUILT OR EXPEDITION SHIPS!!!</span> 
												These ships use
												some additonal mechanism to determine physical characteristics of the ship beyond just a seed value, and honestly I'm not sure what that is. But 
												I do know that 
												<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">if you use this application to attempt to upgrade a custom built or expedition ship, 
												you will end up with a standard hunk of crap looking ship as a result!</span><BR>

					<a href="#">Teleport Endpoints Tab</a>
					<ul>
						<li>
							<a href="#">Explanation</a><BR>
							Within an NMS save file there is a section called "Teleport Endpoints" that stores some number of previous places you have teleported. It can be up into the hundreds of
							endpoints. The main purpose of this tab section is to allow you to set your current player location to the approximate location of such an endpoint (see the right click menus).
							I use it for two purposes. 
							1) to attempt to find some location from my past that I thought was lost. 2) Just as another fun way to explore. So many times I am in some area and don't really do it justice
							in exploration before I move on, and I never threw a base there, but if it's on this list obviously *something* caused me to want to go there. 
							I will use this feature to give me an option to re-explorer
							places on the theory that at times maybe I didn't give a place enough time.<BR><BR>
							
							If you use this feature to teleport to a base that has since been removed and the portal is no longer there, it seems that the game places you in the space station for
							that system. Testing has shown it will at times put you right at the location where the advertised portal was, but I would advise that you should view this more like
							repeating exploration of a previous *area* that you had been to rather than expecting it will put you dead smack on a previous portal location every time.

							<ul>
								<li>
									<a href="#">Highlight Text in Box</a><BR>
									Will highlight and grab focus on the data source line corrisponding to right clicked tree node, in the text window on the right hand side.																						<BR>
																			<BR/>
								</li>
								<li>
									<a href="#">Toggle Expansion 2 Levels</a><BR><BR>
									This will toggle node expansion. If the the node starts out closed, it will expand two levels deep from the right clicked node. If the node was already opened, it's just going to 
									close the right clicked node.																							<BR>
																				<BR/>
								</li>

									<a href="#">Delete Node</a><BR>
									Deletes the right clicked node.																								<BR>

						<li>
							<a href="#">'Base Processing' Tab - ***Specific to top level Base Nodes***</a>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<a href="#">Back Up a Base</a><BR>
									Allows saving off a single base. The main thought for this feature within this tool is really to be able to easily move bases from one save to another.
									It's obviously not going to complete with other save file editors for organizational feature richness in this area.<BR><BR>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#">'Base Processing' Tab - ***Specific to the very top most Array Node ONLY***</a>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<a href="#">Restore a Base</a><BR>
									Will allow you to pick a previously backed up base file to create and insert a new Base node at the top of the tree.<BR><BR>
								</li>
							</ul>
						</li>
						<li>
							<a href="#">'Inventory Processing' Tab - Specific to the top level Inventory Processing tree nodes</a>
							<ul>
								<li>
									<a href="#">Backup this Inventory</a><BR>
										Saves off all items in this inventory to a file. Be aware that on importing later via 'Replace Parts from Backup', all parts in the target are replaced by the saved off parts.<BR><BR>
										The functionality here is meant to allow you to keep backups sets of default inventory items to be placed in any of the inventory containers on demand.
										
										<BR><BR>
								</li>
								<li>
									<a href="#">Replace Items from Backup</a><BR>
										This will clear existing parts and replace them with the items from the saved file.<BR><BR>
										Different from backing and restoring up a base on the Base Processing tab, the Replace/Restore functionality here 
										does NOT create a new storage container. The logic for this feature essentially copies inventory items from the saved file, into the selected existing 
										target inventory (that is, the inventory storage that you right clicked on to start this process) replacing whatever was there originally.
