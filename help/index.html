				<h1>BBB NMS Save File Manipulator - Help</h1>
				DISCLAIMERS: I cannot be held liable for any damage this app causes. Period. I have been a software engineer for over 20 years and while I have a confidence in my work, 
				I also know end users will find every flaw in even the best engineered applications, whereas I am a one man show over here. :) I recommend that you save off back up copies 
				of your save files before you use any editor at all, and be aware that BBB NMS Save File Manipulator must really be used by technical experts only. If you are not super 
				comfortable with JSON files, file manipulation, and all aspects of what you see in the app, just stop and do not use it! If you do find any errors I need to know about, 
				I am BigBuffaloBill over on Discord. But please DO NOT write and tell me I wrecked your game! My answer will be "no problem; just use the backup file I told you to make
				and go restore yourself." :) I do use this application regularly myself at this point, but I make backups just in case!!

					<li>
						<a href="#">Base Processing Tab</a>
						<ul>
							<li>
								<a href="#">File Menu</a><BR>
								Open, Save, Save As - Typical file operations, in this case specific to saving off the complete base data represented in the tab. For example, I might name one of these files
				"Save Slot 1 Bases".							<BR>
								<BR>
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="#">Help Menu</a><BR>
							    You are looking at it!<BR>
								<BR>
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="#">Tree Window Functionality</a>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<a href="#">"Sync from Text Window" Button</a><BR>
								Syncs over data from the Text Edit box on the right. For performance reasons it is not prudent to update the tree on each key stroke in the text edit box. So instead we mark a status Led
						telling you a sync is needed, and then you can decide when you want do a sync.											<BR>
													<BR>
									</li>
									<li>
										<a href="#">"Tree Synced" LED</a><BR>
													
							Indicates if the tree needs to be synched from the Text Edit box on the right. If Green, they are synced. If Red they are not synced.												<BR>
														<BR>
									</li>		
									<li>
													<a href="#">"Sort By Gal, Sys, Name" Button</a><BR>
												
							Sorts all top level Base Nodes by Galaxy, then by System within Galaxy,and then alphbetically by Name within the System. 
							This function is really what motivated the entire application. In one click you have your bases organized in some way that makes sense.														<BR>
																<BR>
									</li>											
									<li>
													<a href="#">"Background Processing" LED</a><BR>
												
								Indicates if there is background processing happening. This app is intended to be able to work with very large files, but certain operations can cause lag
								and slowness
								in the app until they complete. (This was true especially early in development; at this point I have revised most operations observed to cause lag, however...) 
								If this LED turns yellow YOU MAY STILL attempt further app use, but if you find you are not getting an immediate response to new inputs you may need to wait until
								the LED turns green again. When the LED is green the app is in an idle state with little processing happening. (For techies: it's counting the number of child threads for the app
								and thresholds determined via observation)																<BR>
																		<BR/>
									</li>						
									<li>
										<a href="#">Tree Right Click Menu</a>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<a href="#">Common to all Tree Nodes</a>
												<ul>
													<li>
														<a href="#">Highlight Text in Box</a><BR>
											Will highlight and grab focus on the data source line corrisponding to right clicked tree node, in the text window on the right hand side.																						<BR>
																								<BR/>
													</li>
													<li>
														<a href="#">Toggle Expansion 2 Levels</a><BR><BR>
										This will toggle node expansion. If the the node starts out closed, it will expand two levels deep from the right clicked node. If the node was already opened, it's just going to 
										close the right clicked node.																							<BR>
																									<BR/>
													</li>
													<li>
														<a href="#">Delete Node</a><BR>
										Deletes the right clicked node.																								<BR>
																								<BR/>
													</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li>
												<a href="#">Specific to top level Base Nodes</a>
												<ul>
													<li>
														<a href="#">Back Up a Base</a><BR>
											Allows saving off a single base. The main thought for this feature within this tool is really to be able to easily move bases from one save to another.
											It's obviously not going to complete with other save file editors for organizational feature richness in this area.																									<BR>
																												<BR>
													</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
											<li>
												<a href="#">Specific to the top most Array Node ONLY</a>
												<ul>
													<li>
														<a href="#">Restore a Base</a><BR>
				Will allow you to pick a previously backed up base file and then add a base node to the top of the tree.																											<BR>
																							<BR>
													</li>
												</ul>
											</li>
										</ul>
									</li>
									<li>
								<a href="#">Tree Drag and Drop Functionality</a><BR>
Tree data nodes may be dragged and dropped to manually reorder within the tree. Tree view changed are automatically synced to the text window. Child nodes will be 
prevented from moving unless they have the same data type in their parent nodes.
Dragging upward amoungst direct siblings will drop the dragged node above above the targetted drop target.  
Dragging downward amoungst direct siblings will drop the dragged node below the targetted drop target. If you drop to a target under a different parent, the draggd node will always
drop below the drop target. The primary tested purpose for this is to allow manual reordering of the highest level base tree nodes.																								<BR>
											<BR>
									</li>
								</ul>	
							</li>
							<li>
								<a href="#">Text Area Window Functionality</a>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<a href="#">"Copy to Clipboard" Button"</a><BR>
										This will copy the entirety of the text in the text area window, to your system clipboard as if you had done a select all, and copy. This is the easiest way
										to grab all your changes and paste into the save editor of your choice for final output to the live game.
										<BR>
										<BR>
									</li>
									<li>
										<a href="#">"Pretty Print" Button"</a><BR>
										Reformats the bases Json in the text window in a more organized way.	
										<BR>
										<BR>
									</li>
									<li>
										<a href="#">Text Area Right Click Menu</a><BR>
										In this window the functionality will be pretty standard to any text editor. Of note, there is a search text feature. 
										<BR>
										<BR>
									</li>
								</ul>			
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="#">Starship Processing Tab</a>
						<ul>
						<li>
								<a href="#">File Menu</a><BR>
								Please see the common information as provided up above in the 'Base Processing Tab' Section. <BR>

								<a href="#">Tree Window Functionality</a><BR>
								<ul>
									<li>
										<a href="#">Common Functionality</a><BR>
											As with most other detail in this "Starship Processing Tab" help section, much of the functionality is common to the information you may find up above,
											but in this case used in a context of Starship data instead of Base data. I will highlight the one major 
											difference next: the "Upgrade Starships" Button.<BR><BR>
									</li>
									<li>
										<a href="#">"Upgrade Starships" Button</a><BR>
										The functionality of this button will be to Upgrade all of your Starships as pasted into the text window, with one click. Read on to understand
										process and setup.<BR><BR>
										<ul>
											<li>
												<a href="#">General Functionality</a><BR>
													The way it works is, for each Starship, your Starship Name and Seed are saved off. The Starship Seed is a hex data value that is used by
													the game to specify all aesthetic aspects of your Starship. Build parts, color, physical configuration. We then replace each Starship's complete 
													data with upgraded reference Starship data for the same type (Fighter, Sentinel, Hauler, etc) of Starship as the original. We then overwrite
													the Name and Seed of the reference data with your orginal ship's data. In this way you end up with what is basically the same ship, but with all
													the upgrades applied to it. (Please read on...)<BR>
											<BR>
											</li>
											<li>
												<a href="#">Reference Ship Data</a><BR>
													For Each ship type of Explorer, Fighter, Hauler, Living, Royal, Sentinel, Shuttle, Solar (other ship types not yet tested, YMMV),
													there is a reference file that lives in the same
													directory as the program files, called respectfully: reference_explorer.json, reference_fighter.json, reference_hauler.json, reference_living.json,
													reference_royal.json,
													reference_sentinel.json, reference_shuttle.json, and reference_Solar.json. These come with the data I use to upgrade my own ships, but they each contain
													the Json for a standard starship as you can grab from the other save editors. If you want to apply your own upgrades you would just copy the Json data
													for a starship you want to use, and paste it into the appropriate reference file for the ship type. From that point on your data would be used for that
													Starship type. <BR>													
												<BR>
											</li>
											<li>
												<a href="#">Actual Button Usage</a><BR>
													When you hit the button you will be presented a dialog box allowing you to pick the starships you wish to upgrade. Only those startships indicated will
													be upgraded. Just check off those you want to upgrade and hit enter. The results will be propegated to the Tree and Text windows.<BR>
													<BR>
													<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">***IMPORTANT***: Do NOT attempt to upgrade custom built or expedition ships
													(Iron Vulture, Starborn Runner, etc)!!! I'll say it again: DO NOT ATTMEPT TO
													UPGRADE CUSTOM BUILT OR EXPEDITION SHIPS!!!</span> 
													These ships use
													some additonal mechanism to determine physical characteristics of the ship beyond just a seed value, and honestly I'm not sure what that is. But 
													I do know that 
													<span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">if you use this application to attempt to upgrade a custom built or expedition ship, 
													you will end up with a standard hunk of crap looking ship as a result!</span><BR>
